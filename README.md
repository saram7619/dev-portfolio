Overview
The challenge

Users should be able to:

    Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
        Any field is empty
        The email address is not formatted correctly
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    Bonus: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
    Bonus: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design
